# Playwright & Test Automation


## Process

I started the #30Days series as a way to create structured learning roadmaps to help anyone explore a new technology or topic over the span of one month. The goal was to break down the topic into 4 themed weeks, then break down each theme into 7 posts (one per day) that would help you progress incrementally from learning core concepts to building solutions and adopting best practices.

However, I realized this was a good way to plan and execute _any_ month-long project. Some examples:
 - Pick a new technology and learn it in 30 days
 - Build an application from scratch in 30 days
 - Deconstruct, then extend, an open-source project in 30 days
 - Identify 30 tips or tricks for productive use of a tool or framework


## History

In Dec 2021, I started on my first #30Days project as a **solo** contributor. My focus was [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), then a rising star in the automated testing space and a fast-moving technology with rich tooling and intuitive usage that made me want to do more with Test Automation.

So I began my learning journey in [#30DaysOfPlaywright - 2021 Edition](https://aka.ms/30daysOf/Playwright) documenting what I learned each day for a week. At the end of that, it was clear I needed to pause and rethink my strategy.
 * There was a lot to cover, and each post was getting really long!
 * The technology was evolving fast, and I needed a better way to navigate it
 * The [Hugo-based static site](https://nitya.github.io/learn-playwright/) used Golang, and I needed options I could extend
 
Fortunately, I had the opportunity to work with a team on the [#30DaysOfPWA](https://aka.ms/30DaysOf/PWA) project which kickstarted a year of iterative collaborations where I learned how to plan & execute these better, and grew expertise in a single platform ([Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)) as a customizable React-based platform that provided the rich feature set I needed.

## Today

So here we are in Feb 2023, as I wrap a year of projects. And it occurred to me that I wanted to revisit the Playwright learning journey. But this time, build on what I learned **and** add a couple of new objectives:
 * Create content as units that can be assembled into weekly sprints or monthly roadmaps
 * Explore using GitHub CoPilot (AI Pair Programmer) to understand value for test automation
 
I also want to spend a year building expertise in **video content creation** so expect content units to be a mixture of a short video (here's a concept) and a hands-on exercise (let's walkthrough that in code). Each section will have a **ðŸ¤– Prompt Me!** sidebar that will discuss how we could use GitHub CoPilot to assist us in executing that lesson for efficiency and consistency.
